== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Is it possible to migrate to the same domain on a different directory? =
Yes, it's possible to migrate within same domain using different folders.
You can have your source store in root - www.mystore.com and target store in some subfolder - www.mystore.com/targetstore/

= Does Cart2Cart migrate languages? =
Cart2Cart offers a possibility to map (but not migrate) languages that already exist on your source store with those that will be displayed on a target cart. In order to avoid inconveniences, before migration you have to create proper languages on a target store. To do that you have login to your admin panel, enter language section and create new or edit already existing languages.

= Migration of stores with the same URLs =
After you've provided Source and Target store URLs and performed Demo migration, you can not start new migration with the same store URLs. In Migration Wizard you will receive a notice and will be redirected to the previous migration steps. You will be able to edit current migration settings, or provide new store URLs.
If for some reason you have to perform another migration with the same store URLs after Full migration was completed you have to request for Remigration service. Note that remigration requires clearing all the data that was migrated into your target store during the initial migration. In case you have some new items on your Source store that you want to migrate after Full migration is complete, you can use the option of Recent Data Migration.

= Do you support customized shopping carts? =
Yes, we offer partial cart customization. Our service works directly with databases. Visual and functional store customization doesn’t affect the migration process. Some database extra fields are supported as well. Customized Migration Service is done on customer’s request.
Some database extra fields are supported as well.
You can use DEMO migration to check how your cart customization will be performed. 

= Why do I need to clear current data from the Target Store in order to restart migration? =
Usually, restart migration means that something is wrong with the data on a Target Store. It can be influenced by 3rd party extensions, inappropriate development, bugs during shopping cart installation, etc. That is why launching a new migration (remigration) to a store, filled with corrupted or modified data, is not recommended since there is a risk of mixing/duplicating data. In order to avoid this you will need to clear current data from a Target Store before migration. In this case all the corrupted/modified data will be deleted. Your Source data will be moved to a clear Target Store, preserving relationships between entities.

Please note! Clearing data from a Target Store is irreversible option, so we highly recommend to make a backup before restarting the migration.
